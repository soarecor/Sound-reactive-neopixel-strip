# Sound-reactive-neopixel-strip
This tutorial will highlight how to take sound output from the audio jack of a computer or phone and use the outputted signal to make a WS2812 led neopixel strip illuminate responsively. This code uses a total of 90 neopixels in the led strip. The code is adapted from "such builds" youtube video and code.

To connect to the audio jack I am using a double sided stereo cable connected to crocodile clip wire. It is important to attach the crocodile clip to either the first or second "rung" on the stereo cable, since these correspond to the left and right channels respectively. Please refer to the images below in the directory.
